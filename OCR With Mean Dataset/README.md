## OCR with mean dataset in VBScript and ByteScout PDF Extractor SDK

### OCR with mean dataset in VBScript

Today you are going to learn how to OCR with mean dataset in VBScript. ByteScout PDF Extractor SDK was made to help with OCR with mean dataset in VBScript. ByteScout PDF Extractor SDK is the SDK is designed to help developers with pdf tables and pdf data extraction from unstructured documents like pdf, tiff, scans, images, scanned and electronic forms. The library is powered by OCR, computer vision and AI to provide unique functionality like table detection, automatic table structure extraction, data restoration, data restructuring and reconstruction. Supports PDF, TIFF, PNG, JPG images as input and can output CSV, XML, JSON formatted data. Includes full set of utilities like pdf splitter, pdf merger, searchable pdf maker and other utilities.

The SDK samples like this one below explain how to quickly make your application do OCR with mean dataset in VBScript with the help of ByteScout PDF Extractor SDK. This VBScript sample code should be copied and pasted into your applicationâ€™s code editor. Then just compile and run it to see how it works. Further enhancement of the code will make it more vigorous.

##### ****ExtractTextFromImageOrScannedPdfUsingMeanOcrDataset.vbs:**
    
```
' This example demonstrates the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text 
' from scanned PDF documents and raster images.


' Create TextExtractor object
Set extractor = CreateObject("Bytescout.PDFExtractor.TextExtractor")
extractor.RegistrationName = "demo"
extractor.RegistrationKey = "demo"

' Load sample PDF document
extractor.LoadDocumentFromFile("..\..\sample_ocr.pdf")


' Enable Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
extractor.OCRMode = 1 ' OCRMode.Auto = 1

' Set the location of OCR language data files
extractor.OCRLanguageDataFolder = "c:\Program Files\Bytescout PDF Extractor SDK\ocrdata_best"
			
' Set OCR language
' "eng" for english, "deu" for German, "fra" for French, "spa" for Spanish etc - according to files in "ocrdata" folder.
extractor.OCRLanguage = "eng"  
' Find more language files at https://github.com/bytescout/ocrdata/tree/master/ocrdata

' Set PDF document rendering resolution
extractor.OCRResolution = 300


' You can also apply various preprocessing filters to improve the recognition on low-quality scans.
' But they significantly hit the performance, so do not enable them by default.

' Automatically deskew skewed scans
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddDeskew()

' Remove vertical or horizontal lines (sometimes helps to avoid OCR engine's page segmentation errors)
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddVerticalLinesRemover()
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddHorizontalLinesRemover()

' Repair broken letters
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddDilate()

' Remove noise
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddMedian()

' Apply Gamma Correction	
'extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddGammaCorrection()

' Add Contrast
' extractor.OCRImagePreprocessingFilters.AddContrast(20)


' (!) You can use new OCRAnalyzer class to find an optimal set of image preprocessing 
' filters for your specific document.
' See "OCR Analyser" example.

	
' Save extracted text to file
extractor.SaveTextToFile("output.txt")

WScript.Echo "Extracted text saved as 'output.txt'."

Set extractor = Nothing
